# Project Idea - NATIVENESS

I tried to use a minimum number of libraries.

The required lib is `pg`, because i can't recreate it.

# Notes

Vanilla JS is so uncomfortable...

2000s web devs - ðŸ’€

# How to Improve

1. Split `public/script.js` by `pages`.
2. Create a `library` (smth like mini express) to improve `dx`.
3. Review `html` and `css` markup, come up with a `good design`.

# This project should work...
